    <p>Hi, I’m Tayyaba! I’m a Front-End Developer with skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and ReactJS, and I also know Python and C++. I’m passionate about building interactive and user-friendly web applications, and I’m exploring Machine Learning to apply AI in solving real-world problems.Alongside tech, I love volunteering and giving back to the community. I’ve worked with freelancing and welfare societies, hosted a development event, and currently serve as a management member of ACM Society and contribute to the GDG SoC team. In January, I’ll volunteer at a youth gathering with Alkhidmat Foundation.
In my free time, I enjoy sketching and playing badminton. I love learning, taking on new challenges, and combining my tech skills with creativity and social work to make a positive impact.</p>
